# Salah Signal
A Chrome web extension created by Naeem Baig, Rahma Mahmoud, Minseung Jeon, and Melanie Tran for HTV8 (Hack the Valley 8).
This extension reminds the user about when the prayer times are, closing all tabs except those whitelisted when it becomes time for prayer. After fifteen minutes, the user will be allowed to browse again as usual.

# What's next?
Creating different presets for different faiths, as well as an app to signal on mobile devices.
